  <h3>Taznim Reza</h3>
  <p> My name is Tasnim, and I’m running for the position of VP- Events Coordinator. I’m incredibly passionate about robotics, and have been working with the field for the past 4 years! I have experience being the Mechanical Team Captain for my FRC robotics team, a member of multiple Hackathons, and I am also an Executive Team Member of UofTHacks. </p>
  
  <p> As the VP- Events Coordinator, I would love to help organize events which would not only introduce students to the field of robotics, but encourage them to pursue it! I also believe that UTM students deserve more networking opportunities to speak with tech companies, and would love to be work alongside these companies to organize events and workshops where students are able to further their careers. I truly believe that the robotics field has so much potential at UTM, and I would love to help it grow! Vote for me so we can further the potential of our club! Thank you. </p>

  <h3>Laura Maldonado</h3>
  <p> I am currently a first year student who took part in the robotics club this year. I took robotics courses as part of my extracurriculars in high school and this is actually the topic that got me to pursue Computer Science in  University. I currently plan to pursue a mix of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence throughout my years in university and truly believe that this club can help be strengthen my knowledge in these areas. </p>
  
  <p> I love connecting with others and believe that I would be fit for the Events Coordinator position. During my summer Internship at Microsoft, as a Product Marketing Manager Intern, I learned many valuable skills like collaborating with others to materialize great ideas, and learned to speak in front of 500 people to introduce the app that we did with my colleagues. I hope that I can bring these skills to the robotics clubs, to work with other organizations like the HackLab, WISC, Icube, Academia, and any collaborators that I can find through my past experiences. I would be happy to work with these societies to really bring Robotics to UTM, especially with the start of the Robotics institute! </p>
  
  <p> Have a great day, </p>
  <p> Laura Maldonado </p>
